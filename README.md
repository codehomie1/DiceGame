# DiceGame

The starting files for this game was taken from Angela's Web Development course from working with the DOM section.

The purpose of this game was to practice linking javascript to an HTML file and using it to 
control Elements in the Document Object Model.

From this simple project I practiced working with the DOM in many ways such as changing innerHTML,
elements to updating img element sources, and controlling the winner of the game using simple javascript logic.

To play the game, clone or download the files, them either open the file as a live server in VSCODE or any other text editor
then refresh the page to start rolling the Dice!
